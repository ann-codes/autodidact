# Weekly Learning Notes of an Autodidact
Are you like me and you are teaching yourself how to code with various resources? When one is stuck in the weeds of the day-to-day, we can lose sight of how far we've come from our very first day and only think about our current difficulties. 

So I created this page to track my progress, the time spent on coding/learning to code, and wins and struggles along the way. 

## Weekly Progress Notes
*The goal is to dedicate at least 20 hours each week to coding as denoted by ^ when it is a good week.  Weeks are defined as Monday through Sunday and is ordered by most recent. Time is tracked with [Toggle](https://toggl.com/) (best app ever!) and this file is sometimes edited in [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io).*

Start at the bottom at the beginning and the [pre-note notes](https://ann-codes.github.io/autodidact/#pre-notes-notes).  

**Week 32: 11/18 - 11/24: 8hrs 36mins**
-   Yep, definitely feeling burnt out in regards to everything the day job + coding. Everyday just feels like a dogfight lately. So I watched a lot of Netflix during this time and was generally unproductive with everything. It felt like I barely had the motivation to muster these 8 hours. 
-   The Lighthouse Labs 21-day of coding concluded. You can find the [challenges along with my answers here](https://github.com/ann-codes/LHL-21-DayCodeChallenge/blob/master/index.js) (and code by some other folks I found useful). It felt like this time *breezed* by even though I spent about the same amount of time in aggregate as last time (8hrs now, vs 8.5 hours then). But because I struggled so much then, it just felt longer. 
-   I finished that VBA course. It's crazy how much I am able to quickly pick up and follow along with that course because I already know programming from working with Javascript! VBA really is very simple and straight forward. I just need to familiarize with the syntax to become better at it. 
-   For the appreticeships and bootcamps: I fianlly heard back from Apprenti and I am selected to interview with their employer partners! (*OMG SO RELIEVED*) It is on the books sort of where they gave me an expected date range that the interviews are happening and I am now waiting to hear back about when exactly. There's probably a ton of back and forth to schedule these things, but it would be super if I can get a direct answer for once. 
-   The TeamTreeHouse TalentPath apprenticeship applications closed on 11/22 of which I submitted mine weeks ago. I suspect I won't hear anything back from them until mid-December if I am lucky, or after the holiday break. 
-   I finally finished recording coding through all the problems with the HackReactor Bootcamp Prep course. I wasn't able to solve the last problem in the allotted time (and then some) where I was tasked to code out a binary search function. It's so simple when someone else explains it, but a total puzzle to someone who hasn't looked at these established algorithms at all. This then led me down the rabbit hole of learning about [algorithms from KhanAcademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms) which I am only about 25% through the course. I am on my very last module for the HR course and need to do the last challenge. Of note is that they changed their technical interview process to allow for group assessments which I hope opens up more time slots.

**Week 31: 11/11 - 11/17: 10hrs 20mins**
-   This week actually started out strong, but started fizzling on Thursday because I started working on yet another job application, the internal one I referenced last week. I was lukewarm about it, but met with the person who was in the role previously who sold me on it, so am throwing my hat in the ring. The end of the weekend was spent dedicating more time to it than I prefer. Tailoring resumes and cover letters to a job takes so much more time that I expect. 
-   About 4 hours was spent on working through HackReactor problems and recording myself while coding. I am showing a slight improvement of instead of just freezing up and getting all nervous (not that anyone would ever see these videos), but actually going through the coding process. I still need to work on the articulation of my thought process. 
-   About 3 hours was going through TeamTreeHouse courses in CSS. CSS makes me happy and I find it fun to work with. It's helping to give ideas on designing my portfolio site. 
-   About 2.5 hours was working through the daily coding challenges for the Lighthouse Labs 21-Day coding. I recall struggling through the last round way back in weeks 4 through 7 and this time around has been SO fun. Most of the problems are on the easy side, but I have been challenging myself by solving it with map, filter, reduce, etc. 
-   About 1 hour was spent on a Linkedin Learning course on VBA programming in Microsoft Excel. I knew a bit of it from way back (in the copy and pasting and not understanding how it works sense) and wanted to understand it better for that internal job I am applying to.

**Week 30: 11/04 - 11/10: 15hrs 40mins**
-   This week's efforts was not bad and the long weekend certainly helped. 
-   I didn't hear back from any opportunity this week. I did however meet with a director at my current workplace who referred me to an internal admin position which I will be applying for. While it's not a coding job (like zero parts coding), at least it is in the IT department, close to where I want to be so I will give it a go. 
-   I've been applying to various bootcamps and have been getting in touch with their admissions officer. This is in case no apprenticeships or new employment work out, and that I do not get accepted into HackReactor. I am heavily considering [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/full-time/) as my second choice bootcamp or possibly even first choice if I don't get the HackReactor scholarship (which is already a longshot by definition). I really like what I am hearing from former students and their guarentees online. 
-   I worked on the Lighthouse Labs daily challenge, some Codewars problems, and CSS courses in TeamTreehouse where each took about 2-ish hours of my time. 
-   About 8 hours of time went to the HackReactor Prep course. I am nearing the end of this course and started doing problems and recording myself going through them. It is a really eye opening experience! I do need to work on talking through the problem better. 

**Week 29: 10/28 - 11/03: 10hrs 3mins**
-   Not too pleased with the amount of time spent this week. What's my excuse? With stress from the day job and putting pressure on myself, I am feeling burnt out. I rebelled by playing more video games than coding this week. 
-   I do want to note that the [LighthouseLabs](https://coding-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca/) started their new 21-day coding challenge again! So far, the problems have been very straightforward. I appreciate how far along I've come from the first challenge with them that I bumbled along spending hours on a single problem to actually understanding things and solving the problems quickly this time around! I've been challenging myself in trying to solve the problems with reduce() for the practice.
-   Apprenti: At the time of this writing (11/4), I haven't heard anything since the last post, but I don't expect to until "mid-November" so hopefully soon.
-   TeamTreehouse: I am still working on the scholarship application and hope to submit it soon. I spent most of the 10 hours this week going through the other JS courses here. I also started checking out the courses in Java (not Javascript) as well. Why? Because the Apprenti program will be training in Java and I basically have free access to TTH likely until 11/22 so I might as well milk it! 
-   HackReactor: It was a bad move to postpone my interview appointment because now the next available date I managed to get is late November, damn! I am going to keep checking in case there are cancellations that I can try to fit in. Some time this week was spent finishing up their prep course, but it is not yet done. 
-   Misc Job Prospects: So I am guessing none of those options really panned out. I've got some rejections, but most of them just ghosted. I really wish these employers could just send a form rejection or something. It is seriously preferable having to wait around. Jeez. 

**Week 28: 10/21 - 10/27: 18hrs 50mins**
-   It's been 2 months of distraction since my last strong effort, but I am glad to have a better time to report this week! Two main activities took the majority of the time:
-   I was invited to join the [Team Treehouse TalentPath](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/talentpath/) Apprenticeship Program to apply to their next [apprenticeship cohorts](https://teamtreehouse.com/talentpath-recruiting-cities). The process is to complete a specific course set up for the cohort then apply to the scholarship to be in consideration. I spent about 7 hours in TTH completing this course and poking around their other courses to get a feel for the platform. It's a great service and I can see why so many people recommend it. Needless to say, I am now in the process of writing up the application for their scholarship, due 11/22. Their program is very similar to the Apprenti model but is such that the apprentice can work a day job while the training occurs (presumably remote training, using the TTH platform) and the training is through a longer time frame before the full-time paid apprenticeship begins. It's still a great program and I am glad to see more of these types of programs becoming available.
-   I worked on about 11 hours' worth of drills with the [HackReactor SE Basics Prep](https://auth.galvanize.com/sign_in). I must say, I feel much better working with objects in JS now because of the time spent on this in this course. *Very valuable*. I do want to note that I postponed the HR technical interview to another date as I want to complete this course before having the interview. The course is now 65% done. Interview TBD, but will probably be scheduled when I get to the 80% completion mark. 
-   I recieved word from Apprenti that I am now in the "candidate pool in consideration for employer partner interviews." It's sort of an in-between stage of being notified that I didn't get rejected (which is good), but before getting notified if I do move to step 3 or not. I'll take a non-rejection any day! But I will also hold my celebration for if/when I do get notified for the employer interviews. Candidates will be notified in mid-November, so let the waiting commence! 

**Week 27: 10/14 - 10/20: 8hrs 49mins**
-   Slight improvement in terms of time from last week. 
-   I spent ~80% of the time still working through the HackReactor Basics Prep for their technical interview I have scheduled in late October, although there is a possibility that I will delay it another week so I can complete the course. The idea of a technical interview is incredibly intimidating so I want to be prepared. I've been working on their scholarship application as well which takes a lot of time that isn't being tracked. 
-   I've started watching [Crash Course Computer Science](https://thecrashcourse.com/courses/computerscience) hosted by [Carrie Anne Philbin](https://about.me/carrieannephilbin) so I can better understand foundational CS concepts. They are conceptual, non-programming videos and are about 10 minutes long but packed with so much information. I will likely watch this series over multiple times. Currently on Episode 8. 
-   Opportunity updates: The Apprenti staff interview went *really* well. It is part interview and part mechanism to practice and get feedback. The feedback I received was great with some small constructive criticism that I hope to improve on. I should know whether or not I advanced in about a week or so. I did hear that they are expecting to cut down from a pool of around 40 candidates to 24, as they have *12 openings* and want their employer partners to be able to interview about 2 candidates each. Not bad odds, but not the best either. 

**Week 26: 10/07 - 10/13 7hrs 13mins**
-   Another slow week. A great deal of it is due to seeing action in the interviewing fronts! This is awesome, but also not great for me because the options are so very different and it is really hard to focus on one thing. 
-   Opportunity A: In the last post, I heard back from Apprenti about moving on to the Staff Interview portion, but this week I finally got something on the books! They allowed for a remote option (which is super fantastic of them) and that is what I will be doing. Super nervous! They also set up some interview prep workshops which I was sadly not able to make. I hope that doesn't bite me in the butt. 
-   Opportunity B: I had a phone interview for one of the tech-ish jobs I applied to. It went well enough, but who knows what I am really up against? It's not a dev job and at best it has maybe 5-10% of simple coding work, but much of it is technical setup and support for various tools. 
-   Opportunity C: A bit of the time has also been spent on going through the [HackReactor SE Basics Prep](https://www.hackreactor.com/prep-programs) [(sign in here, because it's hard to find the login)](https://auth.galvanize.com/sign_in) because I am also applying to the program, targetting their February or March 2020 FT online cohort. This is sort of a last resort if  the job applications or the apprenticeship does not pan out. I've made the decision that becoming a dev is absolutely happening one way or another. I settled on HR because they cost about the same as the other big ones, but requires more time commitment in the 12 weeks. More bang for your buck, if you will. I have the technical interview scheduled on 10/26 and will be prepping for it. 
-   Other than that, much of the time/work has been going through the Zero to Mastery course. I am itching to start the React section soon!

**Week 25: 09/30 - 10/06: 6hrs 2mins**
-   I flew out on Monday for a vacation and came back on Friday. And while it is not the best effort in terms of raw time, I did manage to get some coding in on the flight there and the evenings at the hotel. Granted some of the days I passed out watching stuff 15 minutes into it (there is a lot of walking during the day and I was mostly wiped out by the time I was back at the hotel), it still counts for me and I haven't missed a day yet! #100DaysOfCode 
-   I finally finished the [Modern Javascript Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript/) with Andrew Mead! I need to write a review for the course, but the long and short of it is that it is an excellent course. Maybe it is not the best one for an absolute beginner starting from zero since he uses node.js and moves fairly quickly (which is a plus for me personally). An intermediate-advanced beginner will get a lot out of it. I also enjoy his teaching style which is very similar to my favorite Udemy instructor, Angela Yu. 
-   Other than finishing up Andrew's course, I am continuing with Andrei Neagoie's [Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) bootcamp and should be getting into the React sections soon enough. 
-   Interview alert! While on vacation, I heard back from one of the job applications to schedule a phone interview. I also heard back from Apprenti about moving to the in-person interview with the organization. There appear to be about 40ish people who advanced to this stage where they will be further whittling down before the hiring partner interviews next. There are 13-15 spots with hiring partners, so my odds aren't too bad right now!
 
**Week 24: 09/23 - 09/29: 10hrs 1min**
-   I did a bit better this week in terms of time than last week. Most of it was trying to get back to the swing of things and finishing up the Modern Javascript Bootcamp. I started to review Andrei Neagoie's [The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) bootcamp videos since that will be the next course after finishing the JS Bootcamp. 
-   I'm having my first vacation in about 3 years next week so my mind was preoccupied with planning and packing for that. I do intend to continue coding each day, even while on vacation!
-   I had the initial phone screen for the Apprenti program and it went well enough! Fingers crossed that I move to the next round!
-   Sadly, I lost my daily streak on CodeSignal, though I ended with a 52-day streak of doing at least one problem a day! I think I will do something similar on Codewars or Edabit next since I prefer their UI and set up more. 
 
**Week 23: 09/16 - 09/22: 7hrs 20mins**
-   Last week was finally back to the minimum of 7hr/week, 1hr/day. The high season at work started slowing down at the end of this week though I floundered around a bit because I wasn't sure how to get back into the groove after 4 weeks of distraction. 
-   Much of my time this week was spent on [CodeSignal.com](http://CodeSignal.com) learning MySQL with some JS coding problems here or there. 
-   I also finished up a short course on [Golang](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-go/) on Linkedin Learning. I enjoyed it (because I could actually follow along and understand things!), but it barely touched the surface. I am probably going to shelve learning Go and refocus on JS though. 
-   Of the 6 applications sent, I got 1 denied, 2 pulled the listing, and 2 taking a long time to get back (2 weeks+) so I am assuming I got ghosted. 
-   I mentioned in the last post that I made it to the next step for the [Apprenti](https://apprenticareers.org/apply/) tech apprenticeship program. The phone screen is the first of 3 possible interviews. 1) phone screen 2) in-person interview 3) final interview with the hiring partner which is where they would determine whether or not to hire me before officially getting accepted to the program. Dang, that is scary! But it is also very good motivation to get back to the hustle of self-learning. I need to be ready if I hope to advance all the way through. 
 
**Week 22: 09/09 - 09/15: 4hrs 8mins**
-   How low can I go? Pretty low it seems! I am still doing at minimum a daily coding problem each day. Hence the very low (to me) total coding time above. 
-   However, the time doesn't include job applications, studying for the assessment test, or the networking muscles I have been flexing (very proud of myself here because this awkward panda is not an extrovert).  
-   2 applications were completed this week. Those are the last ones on my list so I am done with applications for now, although I will keep my eyes peeled for tech-ish jobs. I think I have a very good chance of at least getting an interview at one of these 2 since some responsibilities are rare and niche to what I currently do (though not as tech-related as I'd like). 
-   I took the assessment test and scored an 89% (got my butt kicked in the critical thinking part) which I didn't think was good enough and was planning on continuing to study and retake it. But as a spoiler for next week, I was shockingly contacted to set up the initial phone screen! I am VERY EXCITED! I made it to the next step! WHOA!
-   I had less than 150 Linkedin connections a few weeks ago and made a concerted effort to utilize it a bit more and grow my network. My connections are currently at 199. I've learned that it is a great tool to start a conversation!
-   After going to the Apprenti event last week and connecting with folks and actually doing post-event communication and meetups, I've made my first real-life coding buddy! 
 
**Week 21: 09/02 - 09/08: 6hrs 26mins**
-   This was not the best week in part due to busy day job obligations (those that work in education administration know what I am talking about) as well as spending time continuing to apply for tech-ish jobs. These jobs aren't really development jobs but may have some development responsibilities as part of it. Since I am no longer planning on following the education administration career trajectory, I've decided to focus on finding a role that is better suited to pointing me in the right direction. I am doing this in part because I expect the process of finding my first actual dev job to be a long haul and I need a good place to hunker down while learning. Of note is that 3 applications (with individualized cover letters and resumes) were submitted this week!
-   I also attended my first tech type meetup/event this week! It was an information/networking session hosted by [Apprenti](http://apprenticareers.org). It was a great session and I met a lot of people and were able to connect with a few. If you are wondering, yes, I will be applying to the program. So while this is not necessarily coding and I don't count it towards my time, I have been studying up on GMAT type material so I can take the assessment test for Apprenti soon. 
-   The coding activities are my daily coding drills where I have been digging into the MySQL challenges in CodeSignal and learning a lot.
-   I still need to finish up that Modern JS Bootcamp and did some videos at the beginning of this week. I am also still plugging along the courses in the Linkedin Learning [Become a Front-End Web Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-front-end-web-developer) track. 

**Week 20: 08/26 - 09/01: 7hrs 53mins**
-   To put it plainly, this was not a good week for coding and IRL stuff. Work is now in one of its high seasons and has been getting more stressful which leaves less mental capacity to think/learn to code. There were also some personal issues that have been occupying my spare time as well. While I still code or do something coding in some capacity each day, some days only saw at best 20 mins or so going through a CodeSignal problem and that's it. 
-   I hoped to have it finished by now, but I am still going through the Modern Javascript Bootcamp course on Udemy. I only managed to get to 82% (from 71%) by the end of this week.
-   A silver lining is that I did spend some time applying for an internal position that is not a developer/engineering job, but has some HTML/CSS/JS responsibilities. This is a lateral move of sorts that hopefully does not have a reduction in pay, but I am willing to take a small cut because it provides a clearer step in the right direction. I will also be applying for other similar tech-oriented internal roles if I can find any more. I am annoyed that I didn't do this sooner. And no, I don't quite feel ready yet to apply for dev jobs right now since I have been telling myself that I 1) need a portfolio and 2) need to build a CRUD application from scratch for the experience and to add to my portfolio. I am probably a few months away from this. 

**Week 19: 08/19 - 08/25: 20hrs 3mins^**
-   This week had a good start as I was wrapping up the [Pomodoro Clock project](https://ann-codes.github.io/javascript-pomodoro-clock/)  (it's finally done!), but tapered out a bit in the middle as I was figuring out the next steps/projects to work on. I waffled on whether or not to start the next Odin Project (building a "library" a la to-do list) or to finish up some languishing Udemy courses. 
-   I decided to go with the Udemy courses and plan to finish the [Modern Javascript Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript/) with Andrew Mead before starting another project. A lot of the exercises in the course cover the next few projects I will be working so it seemed like a good refresher to have. That was the bulk of the activity for the remainder of the week, where I ended at about 71% or so complete (from 50%). 
-   I am still working on at least a daily code problem on [CodeSignal](https://www.codesignal.com) although I do occasionally use Edabit and/or Codewars as the mood strikes me. 
-   For several weeks now, during downtime such as my lunch break, car rides, while on the stationary bike, the time before bed, or when I have a moment to myself but can't get in front of a computer, I've been watching the Linkedin Learning courses following their [Become a Front-End Web Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-front-end-web-developer) track and their [Become a Full-Stack Web Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-full-stack-web-developer) track. I don't code along while watching these courses, given the circumstances. This is more so to keep myself immersed and getting familiar with concepts and code when I do dig deeper into a particular topic later (like React and Redux). These videos are typically consumed in 1.5x-2.0x speed and count for half or less time. 
 
**Week 18: 08/12 - 08/18: 15hrs 2mins**
-   Not the best week, but I guess I beat last week by a minute? 
-   9 hours were spent on the Pomodoro clock project. I ended up redoing a great deal of it from using Date() to track time to just using only setInterval() since that was the simpler solution. This was what I should have done at the very beginning, but didn't because I like to complicate things for myself. I also intended to use ProgressBar.js, but I was not able to get it working with a pause functionality. It appears that other people trying to do the same thing encountered similar issues and am not experienced enough to resolve that with the library. However, I will attempt to create my own progress bar (or circle in this case) on my own with CSS. 
-   This week, after fishing for an excuse to myself, I finally admitted to myself that I had been unmotivated and dragging my feet on working on coding and working on projects because this is **HARD** and frustrating and sometimes I just don't want to feel so dumb all the time. There are no other excuses. It's the nature of coding to have the high highs and low lows and it's something I need to get used to and just keep putting in my time. 

**Week 17: 08/05 - 08/11: 15hrs 1min**
-   This week was not as productive as I liked. I have been working on the latest project on The Odin Project, which is to build a [Pomodoro Clock](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project). It's also a project for FCC that I will refactor later. ~11 hours was spent on this project and it is still not done (granted, I did put in more effort on the styling and am optionally including [ProgressBar.js](https://kimmobrunfeldt.github.io/progressbar.js/) in the project). 
-   The hope was to finish it over the weekend, but it's getting to the end of summer so family and friends have been throwing a lot of events over the weekend. I'd end up putting in a bit of time right before bed (sometimes in bed) that often goes into the AM and being sleepy is not the best mindset to be coding in. I am going to try to find different ways to balance this for the next week. 

**Week 16: 07/29 - 08/04: 15hrs 17mins**
-   The week started strong with working on the  [Javascript Calculator](https://ann-codes.github.io/javascript-calculator/) project. More time was spent on it than expected because I started by going down the wrong path (pushing numbers into arrays and other inefficient ways of doing things). I ended up starting again from scratch after about 3hrs of coding. The minimum requirements were finished by Saturday, but I still need to add in keyboard support.
-   I was ready to put in at least 10 hours over the weekend, but a shitty work-related email on Friday derailed me and I had to spend the weekend getting out of that hole.
-   I changed my personal branding from "AnnCanCode" to just "AnnCodes" which includes  [Github](https://github.com/ann-codes)  that then changed all the URLs for the various projects. Good thing I don't have too many right now!
-   I decided to do at least 1 coding challenge a day just to keep me on my toes. I'm planning on using [CodeSignal.com](https://app.codesignal.com/profile/anncodes)  (but will also still use Edabit and Codewars). The site itself is an amazing example of UX and gamification done right.

**Week 15: 07/22 - 07/28: 25hrs 23mins^**
-   Had a 6hr day on Monday and got to 50% of Andrew Mead's Modern JS Bootcamp.
-   The rest of the weekdays were largely working on the next Odin Project Challenge, the  [etch-a-sketch](https://ann-codes.github.io/top-etch-a-sketch/). I spent about 17 hours on it with, about 4 on set up and writing the logic, about 3 hours on CSS, and about 10 hours solely on bug hunting because things just were not working as intended.  [Let's just say I learned what NOT to do with event listeners](https://anncodes.blogspot.com/2019/07/day-115-etch-sketch-project.html).

**Week 14: 07/15 - 07/21: 17hrs 38mins**
-   Reached my Day100 on July 16! Not much fanfare and I am not going to stop. Started Day101 on July 17.
-   I'm trying to quickly work through the Modern Javascript Bootcamp w/ Andrew Mead, targeting projects. His style is very Functional Programming-y which is helpful reinforcement.
-   Decided to go through the projects on  [the Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com/)  with the Rock, Paper, Scissors project as the first stop.  [Started and completed it, with sound](https://github.com/ann-codes/top-rock-paper-scissors)!
-   Also got my  [first Pull Request](https://anncodes.blogspot.com/2019/07/day-103-first-pull-request.html)  accepted and merged to the Odin Project!
-   We were in the middle of a heatwave over the weekend so I barely got any time in over the weekend. Excessive heat is such a huge de-motivator.

**Week 13: 07/08 - 07/14: 24hrs 6mins^**
-   I realized that the 100th day of my #100DaysOfCode was coming fast! I also realized I was getting so close to finishing my second FCC certificate. So this week was all about getting that FCC certificate on or before day 100!
-   I spent a lot of time working through the FCC Intermediate Algorithms but did not finish it all. I will revisit them later and slowly get through the tougher ones.
-   I decided to go ahead with completing the JS and Algorithm projects instead... and yes, I managed to get my certificate upon completing the last problem in the section. I did spend nearly 10 hours on it though and [blogged about it](https://anncodes.blogspot.com/2019/07/day-097-freecodecamp-javascript.html).

**Week 12: 07/01 - 07/07: 32hrs 13mins^**
-   This was a great week full of completions. Finished most sections in the FCC JS and Algorithms section with the exception of the Intermediate Algorithms section. Finished the Codecademy Intro to JS course (which was great!). And the biggy was finishing Angela Yu's [Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).
-   This was all thanks to having my second "Personal Mini Bootcamp" renamed to "Personal Hackathon" 4-day weekend starting from July 4th to July 7th with the goal of coding/learning to code at least 6 hours each day.
-   This week was all about authentication/security, JS async, and APIs. I wrote some basic code for my  [Dad Joke project](https://codepen.io/4nn/pen/NZLXaw)  using the Icanhazdadjoke API. Learned lots.

**Week 11: 06/24 - 06/30: 13hrs 46mins**
-   After realizing the FCC algorithm sections were essentially those code challenges that I enjoy so much, I hit it with full force with a bit over 10 hours going through the problems in the JS Basics and Algorithm section.
-   I front-loaded the hours this week because I knew I would not have much time to devote to coding because of a mini-vacation starting on Thursday through to Sunday.

**Week 10: 06/17 - 06/23: 17hrs 21min**
-   Did mostly Codewars and  [Edabit](https://edabit.com/) coding problems. I finally reached the point where I picked myself out of that ditch.
-   Started and finished the  [#100DaysOfCode Day Counter Project](https://codepen.io/4nn/pen/PvRoqY). I'll probably incorporate this into a bigger app in the future.

**Week 9: 06/10 - 06/16: 13hrs 25mins**
-   Lots of anxiety from the stolen phone incident since it was a huge invasion of privacy for me. At this point, coding or doing anything productive felt like pulling teeth. Most of the time was spent trying to Finish Angela Yu's Bootcamp. Still not done.
-   I joined  [Codewars](https://codewars.com/) at the end of this week. Completing challenges in small bytes made me feel like I am accomplishing at least  _something_. It helped boost morale. Also, the realization that I would not have been able to solve these problems a month ago made me feel good about my progress even though it feels like I haven't been doing all that much.

**Week 8:  06/03 - 06/09: 10hrs 37mins**
-   There were lots of good things that happened this week and I was gearing up for another PMB on Saturday and Sunday. However, my phone got stolen on Saturday morning and then everything went to shit that weekend (and beyond).

**Week 7: 05/27 - 06/02: 22hrs 52mins^**
-   Finished the last day of the PMB on Monday and got to around 70% completion of Angela Yu's course.
-   The LighthouseLabs 30 day challenge concluded. We were able to get back to earth! I found I really enjoyed these byte-sized challenges. I hope they have another such challenge soon.
-   Finished the  [Tip Calculator and Bill Splitter](https://codepen.io/4nn/pen/oREKaY)  project.

**Week 6: 05/20 - 05/26: 29hrs 50mins^**
-   With the exception of Monday catch up, work hours are back to normal again!
-   Started and finished the  [Simple Madlibs project](https://codepen.io/4nn/pen/RmgRQB).
-   Did my "Personal Mini Bootcamp" (PMB) this weekend with at least 8 hours each on Saturday, Sunday, Monday (long weekend). Attacked Angela Yu's  [Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) as the main focus for the weekend. Learned a lot. Got some good coding in.

**Week 5: 05/06 - 05/12: 8hrs 55mins**
-   Busy season at work is underway. This was a really rough week. Too tired to do much other than mostly watching videos on Lynda.com. Did the barest of minimums.
-   Week of 05/13 - 05/19: 15hrs 45min
-   Official last week of the busy season at the Day Job so I celebrated by putting more hours in during the weekend otherwise I'd be below 10hrs/week again.
-   Finished the  [Khan Academy Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming), very cute.

**Week 4: 04/29 - 05/05: 17hrs 43mins**
-   5/1 was the start of the busy season at the Day Job where I have 14-15 hour workdays.
-   Started the LighthouseLabs 30 day coding challenge, which helped kept me coding even just a little bit during the busy season.
-   Started my Accountability Group on Slack.
-   Started looking into Udemy for coding courses.
-   This week had a bit of everything, FCC, Codecademy, and Khan Academy. Note the comment about needing things explained in different ways to me more than once!

**Week 3:  04/22 - 04/28: 11hrs 21mins**
 -  Started tracking time on 4/26 so half this week is missing.
-   Finished [Practical JS](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript)  on WatchAndCode.com, the first course I finished from beginning to end and I did have trouble keeping up and retaining the info.
-   I thought I learned best as a reader through tutorials and written descriptions, but in experiencing the Practical JS course, I found with coding that I need visuals, demonstrations, and things explained to me in different ways more than once for me to understand it.
-   Joined a bunch of Newbie groups on Facebook (Newbie Coder Warehouse, Code Newbie, FCC Boston - though I am yet to physically attend anything)

## Pre-Notes Notes
 - My first day of the [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/AnnCodes/status/1118255929475178496?s=20) was technically on 04/08/2019,  but I did not start tracking my time from day 1 so am missing some notes from that time.
 - However, the majority of the coding/learning during this non-tracked time was spent going through the [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) Responsive Web Design section, focusing primarily on HTML & CSS of which I am already pretty comfortable with.
 - I started learning Javascript on 4/20/2019 on FCC. It was frustrating because I had trouble absorbing and understanding it. Trying to cram it all in and fully understand it within a week was very unrealistic. I later found that I needed the time in between for the [diffuse mode](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/gearing-up) to really start to *get* it. 
 - During this time, I started listening to the [CodeNewbie Podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) to learn more about other people's journeys. It is a useful tool to keep me motivated and entertained on my daily commute.
