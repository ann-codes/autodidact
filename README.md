# Weekly Learning Notes
This page is to track my progress and time spent on coding/learning to code. 
Weeks are defined as Monday through Sunday. 
The time is tracked with [Toggle](https://toggl.com/) (best app ever!). 
My goal is to dedicate at least 20 hours each week to coding (denoted by the *).

## Pre-Table Notes
 - My first day of the #100DaysOfCode was technically on 04/08/2019.
 - I did not start tracking my time from day 1.
 - However, the majority of the coding/learning at this time was going through the [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) Responsive Web Design section.
 - I started learning Javascript on 4/20 on FCC. It was frustrating
 - because I had trouble absorbing and understanding it. Trying to cram it all in and fully understand it within a week was very unrealistic. I later found that I needed the time in between for the [diffuse mode](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/gearing-up) to really start to *get* it. 
 - I started listening to the [CodeNewbie Podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) to learn more about other people's journey.

|04/22 - 04/28|11:21| Started tracking time on 4/26 so half this week is missing.|
|||Finished [Practical JS](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript)  on WatchAndCode.com, the first course I finished from beginning to end and I did have trouble keeping up and retaining the info.|
|||I thought I learned best as a reader through tutorials and written descriptions, but in experiencing the Practical JS course, I found with coding that I need visuals, demonstrations, and things explained to me in different ways more than once for me to understand it.|
|||Joined a bunch of Newbie groups on Facebook (Newbie Coder Warehouse, Code Newbie, FCC Boston - though I am yet to physically attend anything) |
