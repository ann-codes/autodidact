# Weekly Learning Notes of an Autodidact
Are you like me and you are teaching yourself how to code with various resources? When one is stuck in the weeds of the day-to-day, we can lose sight of how far we've come from our very first day and only think about our current difficulties. 

So I created this page to track my progress, the time spent on coding/learning to code, and wins and struggles along the way. 



## Pre-Notes Notes
 - My first day of the [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/AnnCodes/status/1118255929475178496?s=20) was technically on 04/08/2019,  but I did not start tracking my time from day 1 so am missing some notes from that time.
 - However, the majority of the coding/learning during this non-tracked time was spent going through the [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) Responsive Web Design section, focusing primarily on HTML & CSS of which I am already pretty comfortable with.
 - I started learning Javascript on 4/20/2019 on FCC. It was frustrating because I had trouble absorbing and understanding it. Trying to cram it all in and fully understand it within a week was very unrealistic. I later found that I needed the time in between for the [diffuse mode](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/gearing-up) to really start to *get* it. 
 - During this time, I started listening to the [CodeNewbie Podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) to learn more about other people's journey. It is a useful tool to keep me motivated and entertained on my daily commute. 
 
 ## Weekly Progress Notes 
 *The goal is to dedicate at least 20 hours each week to coding as denoted by ^ when it is a good week.  Weeks are defined as Monday through Sunday and is ordered by most recent. Time is tracked with [Toggle](https://toggl.com/) (best app ever!) and this file is sometimes edited in [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io).*
 

**Week 17: 08/05 - 08/11: 15hrs 1min**
-   This week was not as productive as I liked. I have been working on the latest project on The Oding Project, which is to build a [Pomodoro Clock](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project). It's also a project for FCC that I will refactor later. ~11 hours was spent on this project and it is still not done (granted, I did put in more effort on the styling and am optionally including [ProgressBar.js](https://kimmobrunfeldt.github.io/progressbar.js/) in the project). 
-   The hope was to finish it over the weekend, but it's getting to the end of summer so family and friends have been throwing a lot of events over the weekend. I'd end up putting in a bit of time right before bed (sometimes in bed) that often goes into the AM and being sleepy is not the best mindset to be coding in. I am going to try to find different ways to balance this for the next week. 

**Week 16: 07/29 - 08/04: 15hrs 17min**
-   The week started out strong with working on the  [Javascript Calculator](https://ann-codes.github.io/javascript-calculator/)  project. More time was spent on it than expected because I started by going down the wrong path (pushing numbers into arrays and other inefficient ways of doing things). I ended up starting again from scratch after about 3hrs of coding. The minimum requirements were finished by Saturday, but I still need to add in keyboard support.
-   I was ready to put in at least 10 hours over the weekend, but a shitty work related email on Friday derailed me and I had to spend the weekend getting out of that hole.
-   I changed my personal branding from "AnnCanCode" to just "AnnCodes" of which includes  [Github](https://github.com/ann-codes)  that then changed all the URLs for the various projects. Good thing I don't have too many right now!
-   I decided to do at least 1 coding challenge a day just to keep me on my toes. I'm planning on using [CodeSignal.com](https://app.codesignal.com/profile/anncodes)  (but will also still use Edabit and Codewars). The site itself is an amazing example of UX and gamefication done right.

**Week 15: 07/22 - 07/28: 25hrs 23min^**
-   Had a 6hr day on Monday and got to 50% of Andrew Mead's Modern JS Bootcamp.
-   The rest of the weekdays were largely working on the next Odin Project Challenge, the  [etch-a-sketch](https://ann-codes.github.io/top-etch-a-sketch/). I spent about 17 hours on it with, about 4 on set up and writing the logic, about 3 hours on CSS, and about 10 hours solely on bug hunting because things just were not working as intended.  [Let's just say I learned what NOT to do with event listeners](https://anncodes.blogspot.com/2019/07/day-115-etch-sketch-project.html).

**Week 14: 07/15 - 07/21: 17hrs 38mins**
-   Reached my Day100 on July 16! Not much fanfare and I am not going to stop. Started Day101 on July 17.
-   I'm trying to quickly work through the Modern Javascript Bootcamp w/ Andrew Mead, targeting projects. His style is very Functional Programming-y which is helpful reinforcement.
-   Decided to go through the projects on  [the Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com/)  with the Rock, Paper, Scissors project as the first stop.  [Started and completed it, with sound](https://github.com/ann-codes/top-rock-paper-scissors)!
-   Also got my  [first Pull Request](https://anncodes.blogspot.com/2019/07/day-103-first-pull-request.html)  accepted and merged to the Odin Project!
-   We were in the middle of a heatwave over the weekend so I barely got any time in over the weekend. Excessive heat is such a huge de-motivator.

**Week 13: 07/08 - 07/14: 24hrs 6mins^**
-   I realized that the 100th day of my #100DaysOfCode was coming fast! I also realized I was getting so close to finishing my second FCC certificate. So this week was all about getting that FCC certificate on or before day 100!
-   I spent a lot of time working through the FCC Intermediate Algorithms but did not finish it all. I will revisit them later and slowly get through the tougher ones.
-   I decided to go ahead with completing the JS and Algorithm projects instead... and yes, I managed to get my certificate upon completing the last problem in the section. I did spend nearly 10 hours on it though and [blogged about it](https://anncodes.blogspot.com/2019/07/day-097-freecodecamp-javascript.html).

**Week 12: 07/01 - 07/07: 32hrs 13mins^**
-   This was a great week full of completions. Finished most sections in the FCC JS and Algorithms section with the exception of the Intermediate Algorithms section. Finished the Codecademy Intro to JS course (which was great!). And the biggy was finishing Angela Yu's [Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).
-   This was all thanks to having my second "Personal Mini Bootcamp" renamed to "Personal Hackathon" 4-day weekend starting from July 4th to July 7th with the goal of coding/learning to code at least 6 hours each day.
-   This week was all about authentication/security, JS asyncs, and APIs. I wrote some basic code for my  [Dad Joke project](https://codepen.io/4nn/pen/NZLXaw)  using the Icanhazdadjoke API. Learned lots.

**Week 11: 06/24 - 06/30: 13hrs 46mins**
-   After realizing the FCC algorithm sections were basically those code challenges that I enjoy so much, I hit it with full force with a bit over 10 hours going through the problems in the JS Basics and Algorithm section.
-   I front loaded the hours this week because I knew I would not have much time to devote to coding because of a mini vacation starting on Thursday through to Sunday.

**Week 10: 06/17 - 06/23: 17hrs 21min**
-   Did mostly Codewars and  [Edabit](https://edabit.com/) coding problems. I finally reached the point where I picked myself out of that ditch.
-   Started and finished the  [#100DaysOfCode Day Counter Project](https://codepen.io/4nn/pen/PvRoqY). I'll probably incorporate this into a bigger app in the future.

**Week 9: 06/10 - 06/16: 13hrs 25mins**
-   Lots of anxiety from the stolen phone incident since it was a huge invasion of privacy for me. At this point, coding or doing anything productive felt like pulling teeth. Most of the time was spent trying to Finish Angela Yu's Bootcamp. Still not done.
-   I joined  [Codewars](https://codewars.com/) at the end of this week. Completing challenges in small bytes made me feel like I am accomplishing at least  _something_. It really helped boost morale. Also the realization that I would not have been able to solve these problems a month ago really made me feel good about my progress even though it feels like I haven't been doing all that much.

**Week 8:  06/03 - 06/09: 10hrs 37mins**
-   There were lots of good things that happened this week and I was gearing up for another PMB on Saturday and Sunday. However, my phone got stolen on Saturday morning and then everything went to shit that weekend (and beyond).

**Week 7: 05/27 - 06/02: 22hrs 52mins^**
-   Finished the last day of the PMB on Monday and got to around 70% completion of Angela Yu's course.
-   The LighthouseLabs 30 day challenge concluded. We were able to get back to earth! I found I really enjoyed these byte sized challenges. I hope they have another such challenge soon.
-   Finished the  [Tip Calculator and Bill Splitter](https://codepen.io/4nn/pen/oREKaY)  project.

**Week 6: 05/20 - 05/26: 29hrs 50mins^**
-   With the exception of Monday catch up, work hours are back to normal again!
-   Started and finished the  [Simple Madlibs project](https://codepen.io/4nn/pen/RmgRQB).
-   Did my "Personal Mini Bootcamp" (PMB) this weekend with at least 8 hours each on Saturday, Sunday, Monday (long weekend). Attacked Angela Yu's  [Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) as the main focus for the weekend. Learned a lot. Got some good coding in.

**Week 5: 05/06 - 05/12: 8hrs 55mins**
-   Busy season at work is underway. This was a really rough week. Too tired to do much other than mostly watching videos on Lynda.com. Did the barest of minimums.
-   Week of 05/13 - 05/19: 15hrs 45min
-   Official last week of busy season at the Day Job so I celebrated by putting more hours in during the weekend otherwise I'd be below 10hrs/week again.
-   Finished the  [Khan Academy Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming), very cute.

**Week 4: 04/29 - 05/05: 17hrs 43mins**
-   5/1 was the start of busy season at the Day Job where I have 14-15 hour work days.
-   Started the LighthouseLabs 30 day coding challenge, which helped kept me coding even just a little bit during the busy season.
-   Started my Accountability Group on Slack.
-   Started looking into Udemy for coding courses.
-   This week had a bit of everything, FCC, Codecademy, and Khan Academy. Note the comment about needing things explained in different ways to me more than once!

**Week 3:  04/22 - 04/28: 11hrs 21mins**
 -  Started tracking time on 4/26 so half this week is missing.
-   Finished [Practical JS](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript)  on WatchAndCode.com, the first course I finished from beginning to end and I did have trouble keeping up and retaining the info.
-   I thought I learned best as a reader through tutorials and written descriptions, but in experiencing the Practical JS course, I found with coding that I need visuals, demonstrations, and things explained to me in different ways more than once for me to understand it.
-   Joined a bunch of Newbie groups on Facebook (Newbie Coder Warehouse, Code Newbie, FCC Boston - though I am yet to physically attend anything)
