# Weekly Learning Notes
This page is to track my progress and time spent on coding/learning to code. 
Weeks are defined as Monday through Sunday. 
The time is tracked with [Toggle](https://toggl.com/) (best app ever!). 
My goal is to dedicate at least 20 hours each week to coding (denoted by the ^).

## Pre-Table Notes
 - My first day of the #100DaysOfCode was technically on 04/08/2019.
 - I did not start tracking my time from day 1.
 - However, the majority of the coding/learning at this time was going through the [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) Responsive Web Design section.
 - I started learning Javascript on 4/20 on FCC. It was frustrating
 - because I had trouble absorbing and understanding it. Trying to cram it all in and fully understand it within a week was very unrealistic. I later found that I needed the time in between for the [diffuse mode](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/gearing-up) to really start to *get* it. 
 - I started listening to the [CodeNewbie Podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) to learn more about other people's journey. 
 
**Week 12: 07/01 - 07/07: 32hrs 13min^**
-   This was a great week full of completions. Finished most sections in the FCC JS and Algorithms section with the exception of the Intermediate Algorithms section. Finished the Codecademy Intro to JS course (which was great!). And the biggy was finishing Angela Yu's [Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).
-   This was all thanks to having my second "Personal Mini Bootcamp" renamed to "Personal Hackathon" 4-day weekend starting from July 4th to July 7th with the goal of coding/learning to code at least 6 hours each day.
-   This week was all about authentication/security, JS asyncs, and APIs. I wrote some basic code for my  [Dad Joke project](https://codepen.io/4nn/pen/NZLXaw)  using the Icanhazdadjoke API. Learned lots.

**Week 11: 06/24 - 06/30: 13hrs 46mins**
-   After realizing the FCC algorithm sections were basically those code challenges that I enjoy so much, I hit it with full force with a bit over 10 hours going through the problems in the JS Basics and Algorithm section.
-   I front loaded the hours this week because I knew I would not have much time to devote to coding because of a mini vacation starting on Thursday through to Sunday.

**Week 10: 06/17 - 06/23: 17hrs 21min**
-   Did mostly Codewars and  [Edabit](https://edabit.com/) coding problems. I finally reached the point where I picked myself out of that ditch.
-   Started and finished the  [#100DaysOfCode Day Counter Project](https://codepen.io/4nn/pen/PvRoqY). I'll probably incorporate this into a bigger app in the future.

**Week 9: 06/10 - 06/16: 13hrs 25mins**
-   Lots of anxiety from the stolen phone incident since it was a huge invasion of privacy for me. At this point, coding or doing anything productive felt like pulling teeth. Most of the time was spent trying to Finish Angela Yu's Bootcamp. Still not done.
-   I joined  [Codewars](https://codewars.com/) at the end of this week. Completing challenges in small bytes made me feel like I am accomplishing at least  _something_. It really helped boost morale. Also the realization that I would not have been able to solve these problems a month ago really made me feel good about my progress even though it feels like I haven't been doing all that much.

**Week 8:  06/03 - 06/09: 10hrs 37mins**
-   There were lots of good things that happened this week and I was gearing up for another PMB on Saturday and Sunday. However, my phone got stolen on Saturday morning and then everything went to shit that weekend (and beyond).

**Week 7: 05/27 - 06/02: 22hrs 52mins^**
-   Finished the last day of the PMB on Monday and got to around 70% completion of Angela Yu's course.
-   The LighthouseLabs 30 day challenge concluded. We were able to get back to earth! I found I really enjoyed these byte sized challenges. I hope they have another such challenge soon.
-   Finished the  [Tip Calculator and Bill Splitter](https://codepen.io/4nn/pen/oREKaY)  project.

**Week 6: 05/20 - 05/26: 29hrs 50mins^**
-   With the exception of Monday catch up, work hours are back to normal again!
-   Started and finished the  [Simple Madlibs project](https://codepen.io/4nn/pen/RmgRQB).
-   Did my "Personal Mini Bootcamp" (PMB) this weekend with at least 8 hours each on Saturday, Sunday, Monday (long weekend). Attacked Angela Yu's  [Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) as the main focus for the weekend. Learned a lot. Got some good coding in.

**Week 5: 05/06 - 05/12: 8hrs 55mins**
-   Busy season at work is underway. This was a really rough week. Too tired to do much other than mostly watching videos on Lynda.com. Did the barest of minimums.
-   Week of 05/13 - 05/19: 15hrs 45min
-   Official last week of busy season at the Day Job so I celebrated by putting more hours in during the weekend otherwise I'd be below 10hrs/week again.
-   Finished the  [Khan Academy Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming), very cute.

**Week 4: 04/29 - 05/05: 17hrs 43mins**
-   5/1 was the start of busy season at the Day Job where I have 14-15 hour work days.
-   Started the LighthouseLabs 30 day coding challenge, which helped kept me coding even just a little bit during the busy season.
-   Started my Accountability Group on Slack.
-   Started looking into Udemy for coding courses.
-   This week had a bit of everything, FCC, Codecademy, and Khan Academy. Note the comment about needing things explained in different ways to me more than once!

**Week 3:  04/22 - 04/28: 11hrs 21mins**
 -  Started tracking time on 4/26 so half this week is missing.
-   Finished [Practical JS](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript)  on WatchAndCode.com, the first course I finished from beginning to end and I did have trouble keeping up and retaining the info.
-   I thought I learned best as a reader through tutorials and written descriptions, but in experiencing the Practical JS course, I found with coding that I need visuals, demonstrations, and things explained to me in different ways more than once for me to understand it.
-   Joined a bunch of Newbie groups on Facebook (Newbie Coder Warehouse, Code Newbie, FCC Boston - though I am yet to physically attend anything)
